# Site Layout & Navigation Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Header Overlap Problems ✅
**Problem**: Text on Card Gallery, Gameplay, Printing, and Contributing pages was hidden behind the header.
**Solution**: Added consistent `<div class="mt-4"></div>` spacing before all pageinfo sections.

### 2. Missing Icons ✅
**Problem**: Card Gallery section on docs page had no icon.
**Solution**: Updated to use FontAwesome icons:
- Card Gallery: `fa-images` 
- Getting Started: `fa-play`
- Print at Home: `fa-print`
- Get Involved: `fa-heart`

### 3. Broken Navigation Links ✅
**Problem**: "Read more" buttons on Gameplay and Printing pages didn't work.
**Solution**: Updated all feature block URLs from relative to absolute paths:
- `/docs/gameplay/quick-start/`
- `/docs/gameplay/comprehensive-rules/`
- `/docs/gameplay/formats/`
- `/docs/printing/home-printing-guide/`
- `/docs/printing/recommended-printers/`
- `/docs/printing/cardstock-guide/`

### 4. Navigation Menu Structure ✅
**Problem**: Confusing header navigation where "Printing" highlighted "Documentation".
**Solution**: Simplified menu structure:
- **Before**: Getting Started, Cards, Printing (3 separate items)
- **After**: Documentation, Cards (2 clean items)

### 5. Inconsistent Page Formatting ✅
**Problem**: Pages had inconsistent spacing and styling.
**Solution**: Added consistent pageinfo blocks with appropriate colors:
- Quick Start: Primary blue pageinfo
- Rules: Warning yellow pageinfo  
- Formats: Standard pageinfo
- Home Printing: Standard pageinfo
- Printers: Info blue pageinfo
- Cardstock: Success green pageinfo

## Navigation Improvements

### Simplified Header Menu
```
- Documentation (/docs/) → Hub for all game content
- Cards (/cards/) → Card gallery and downloads
- Contributing (/contributing/) → Community involvement
```

### Better Information Architecture
- **Documentation**: Single entry point for all game content
- **Clear hierarchy**: Main sections → Sub-pages with working links
- **Consistent styling**: All pages follow same layout patterns

## Performance Improvements

### Hero Image Optimization
- **Before**: 2.9MB PNG causing 3.33s LCP
- **After**: 54KB WebP with PNG fallback
- **Expected improvement**: LCP should drop to ~1.5s or better

### Technical Enhancements
- WebP format with PNG fallback using `<picture>` element
- Image preloading for critical hero image
- DNS prefetch for external resources
- Organized static assets in `/static/images/` folder

## Icon System

### FontAwesome Integration
Docsy theme includes FontAwesome by default. Used consistent icons:
- `fa-play` - Getting Started
- `fa-images` - Card Gallery  
- `fa-print` - Printing
- `fa-heart` - Community
- `fa-rocket` - Quick Start
- `fa-book` - Rules
- `fa-chess` - Formats
- `fa-desktop` - Printers
- `fa-file-alt` - Cardstock

### Visual Consistency

```

### Clean Repository Structure
