## **Our Mission**

**To preserve and democratize Magic: The Gathering's strategic depth for future generations.**

We believe that Magic's incredible gameplay shouldn't be locked behind corporate paywalls or artificial scarcity. Forge Realm represents a return to pure Magic where:

- **Players control the game**, not Hasbro shareholders
- **Strategy matters more** than your collection value
- **Communities thrive** through collaboration, not chasing expensive singles
- **Classic Magic lives on** through democratic participation, not corporate decisions
