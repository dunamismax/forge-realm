## **The Magic You Remember at Its Best**

It's the Magic you remember at its best—sharp, interactive, and endlessly replayable—refined until every decision feels clean in the hand and vivid on the table. The rules step out of the way. The drama stays.

You start at twenty life with the London Mulligan, and the game meets you halfway: scry, surveil, cycling, and clues smooth rough draws without erasing variance. Lands remain the heartbeat—one a turn, tap for color, plan your curve—and the color pie still shapes every story you tell.

## **What Makes Ideal Magic Special**

### **Best Mechanics Only**

We've carefully curated the "glue suite" of beloved mechanics that make choices sing:

- **Kicker** lets you scale a spell to the moment
- **Cycling** trades dead draws for live ones
- **Flashback** turns your graveyard into a second hand—once, cleanly
- **Foretell** banks a spell for later, adding tension to the turn
- **Adventure** tucks a cantrip of story into your creature
- **Landfall** rewards the rhythm of natural play
- **Sagas** pace a chaptered arc with visible counters
- **Investigate** gives you Clues: half a card now, a whole card when you're ready

Plus **Raid**, **Surge**, and **Rebound** that celebrate the perfect turns without breaking them.

### **No Problematic Mechanics**

We cut the mechanics that asked you to track ghosts or broke the pace:

- **Storm, Dredge, Companion** - format-warping engines
- **Day/Night, Dungeons, Cipher** - off-board bookkeeping
- **Cumulative Upkeep** - escalating maintenance costs
- **"Free engine" loops** that turn games into solitaire

### **Board-First, Paper-Friendly**

Every moving part lives where you can see it: counters on permanents, tokens on the battlefield, choices made openly. No off-board mini-games to babysit, no global timers to forget.

## **Our Philosophy**

**Familiar, but lighter in the hand** - The air between turns is clearer, the edges safer, the middle richer. We keep the soul—the bluff, the dance, the little adrenaline braid of "do they have it?"—and remove the sand in the gears.

Ideal Magic rewards planning and invites audacity; says "yes" to interaction and "no" to bookkeeping; makes tomorrow's decisions brighter because today's were fair.

### **Core Principles**

- **20 life, London Mulligan** - Classic starting point
- **Ward over Hexproof** - Interaction with a tax, not a wall
- **Choices over bookkeeping** - Complexity in decisions, not administration
- **Board-state clarity** - Everything important is visible
- **The color pie matters** - Each color has its role and restrictions

## **Game Formats**

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ideal Constructed** | 60+ cards, the complete curated card pool |
| **Eternal (Open)** | Ideal + sanctioned cameo reprints |
| **Limited (Draft/Sealed)** | 40+ cards, designed for clear archetypes |
| **Cube** | Custom pools using Ideal-legal cards |

All formats use the same banlist and philosophy - broad interaction, visible tracking, and meaningful decisions every turn.
