## **Our Mission**

**To democratize trading card games and preserve the magic of strategic card play for future generations.**

We believe that the joy of trading card games shouldn't be locked behind corporate paywalls or artificial scarcity. Forge Realm TCG represents a new paradigm where:

- **Players control the game**, not shareholders
- **Strategy matters more** than wallet size
- **Communities thrive** through collaboration, not competition for rare cards
- **Innovation happens** through democratic participation, not boardroom decisions
