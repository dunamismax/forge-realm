{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Welcome, Vintage master!** Ideal Magic respects your deep understanding of Magic's most complex interactions while providing a format where skill in gameplay matters more than access to Power 9 or broken combos.
{{< /callout >}}

## What You Already Know (and Love)

Coming from Vintage, you represent Magic's highest level of technical play. You understand the deepest interactions, most complex stack situations, and most intricate strategic decisions. Ideal Magic preserves that complexity while removing the elements that make games determined by deck construction rather than gameplay skill.

**Your Vintage mastery translates perfectly:**

- **Deep stack interaction** and priority window optimization
- **Complex multiganing** and game state evaluation  
- **Resource management** across multiple axes simultaneously
- **Meta-strategic thinking** and long-term format development
- **Technical precision** in high-stakes competitive environments

| **Workshops vs. Blue metagame** | **Multiple viable strategies** |
