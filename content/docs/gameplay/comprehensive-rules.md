{{< callout type="warning" >}} **Complete Rulebook** — Forge Realm is an homage
to classic Magic: The Gathering that embraces today's best design tech: clear
interaction, consistent game starts, and decisions that matter every turn.
{{< /callout >}}

## 1. Core Game Philosophy

### 1.1 Vintage Design Philosophy

**Core Design Principles:**

- 60-card constructed decks with 4-copy limit (40-card "Blitz" variant
  supported)
- 20 starting life and 7-card opening hands using the **London Mulligan**
- Five-color mana system with color identity and splash tension
- Instants, sorceries, stack-based interaction, and priority sequencing
- Turn structure with two main phases and a robust combat step
- Strategic resource tradeoffs each turn (tempo vs. cards vs. life total)
- **Modern tech adopted:** Ward (evergreen defense), double-faced cards
  (transform/land-modal), predefined tokens (Clue, Food, Map), and selective
  alternative costs (Bargain)
- **Power safety rails:** No Discover; Treasure generation throttled; Plot
  limited to one plotted spell cast per turn; Companion uses the "pay 3 to hand"
  rule
- Dark fantasy aesthetic with mature themes and an emphasis on
  imagination-driven play

### 1.2 Victory Conditions

- **Primary**: Reduce opponent from 20 life to 0
- **Secondary**: Opponent attempts to draw from an empty library
- **Game Length**: 15–45 minutes depending on format and skill level

## 2. Card Types and Classic System

### 2.1 Traditional Card Functions

Cards function according to their type and timing:

#### 2.1.1 Play for Effect

- Cast the card by paying its mana cost
- Follow normal timing restrictions for the card's type
- Resolve all effects; non-permanents go to the graveyard after resolving

#### 2.1.2 Alternative Costs & Set-Aside Casting

- Some cards offer alternative costs (e.g., **Bargain**: sacrifice an
  artifact/enchantment/token as you cast)
- Certain mechanics let you pay now and cast later (e.g., **Plot** places a card
  aside; you may cast a single plotted card you control each turn without paying
  its mana cost)
- These choices create resource tension without introducing unchecked "free
  spell" chains

#### 2.1.3 Instant-Speed Response

- Instants and activated abilities can be used whenever you have priority
- The stack resolves last-in, first-out
- Skillful timing and resource management are central to interaction

### 2.2 Card Categories

#### 2.2.1 Spell Cards (Classic MTG)

- **Instants**: May be cast any time you have priority
- **Sorceries**: Cast only during your main phases when the stack is empty
- Both go to the graveyard after resolving

#### 2.2.2 Permanent Cards

- **Creatures**: Attack, block, and use abilities; track power/toughness and
  damage
- **Enchantments**: Ongoing effects; includes puzzle-like **Cases** that "solve"
  to upgrade their effect
- **Artifacts & Equipment**: Utility, mana, and gear; Equipment attach to
  creatures and remain if the creature dies
- **Lands**: Primary mana sources; some double-faced cards may enter as lands
- **Double-Faced Cards (DFCs/MDFCs)**: Cards with two faces (e.g., transforming
  permanents or spell/land modalities); use the rules text on the face that is
  currently up

## 3. Mana System (Classic Magic)

### 3.1 Mana Generation

- **Land system**: Play one land per turn as the default source of mana
- **Artifacts/creatures**: May produce mana as abilities
- **Spells/abilities**: Can generate temporary mana
- **Pool management**: Mana empties at the end of each step and phase (no mana
  burn)

### 3.2 Mana Colors (Five-Color Magic System)

The five colors of mana each represent distinct philosophies and playstyles:

- <span class="mana-red">**Red Mana**</span>: Aggression, direct damage, haste, chaos
- <span class="mana-blue">**Blue Mana**</span>: Card draw, counter magic, knowledge, trickery
- <span class="mana-green">**Green Mana**</span>: Growth, acceleration, large creatures, resilience
- <span class="mana-white">**White Mana**</span>: Protection, efficiency, order, small-army tactics
- <span class="mana-black">**Black Mana**</span>: Removal, recursion, discard, life-for-power exchanges
- **Colorless**: Often from artifacts; flexible but costlier or with drawbacks

### 3.3 Strategic Resource Decisions

Players make classic decisions with modern smoothing:

- Which lands to play and when; sequencing for color/fetch basics
- How to commit limited mana each turn to pressure or hold-up
- Curve management and color commitments
- **Smoothing tools**: **Clues** (Investigate) to draw; **Maps** (Explore) to
  improve card quality; **Food** to buffer life totals

## 4. Turn Structure (MTG-Based)

### 4.1 Phase Order

1. **Beginning Phase**
   - Untap all permanents
   - Upkeep: resolve "at the beginning of upkeep" effects
   - Draw: active player draws a card

2. **Main Phase 1**
   - Play a land (once per turn)
   - Cast spells (creatures, enchantments, artifacts, sorceries)
   - Activate abilities

3. **Combat Phase**
   - Declare attackers (tap to attack unless they have vigilance)
   - Defender declares blockers; assign and deal combat damage
   - Combat abilities and keywords apply (first strike, trample, etc.)

4. **Main Phase 2**
   - Additional main phase after combat
   - Cast remaining spells or activate abilities

5. **End Phase**
   - "End step" triggers resolve
   - Discard to maximum hand size (7) if necessary
   - Cleanup

### 4.2 Strategic Timing

- **Instant speed**: Respond to spells, abilities, and combat steps
- **Stack system**: Last-in-first-out resolution
- **Priority**: Active player receives priority first each step/phase

## 5. Enhanced Combat System

### 5.1 Combat Declaration

- **Attackers**: Tap eligible creatures to attack the opponent or planeswalkers
  (if present in custom sets)
- **Attack triggers**: Abilities may trigger on attacking, blocking, or dealing
  damage

### 5.2 Defense Options

#### 5.2.1 Creature Blocking (MTG standard)

- Assign untapped creatures as blockers
- Multiple blockers per attacker are allowed; attacking player orders damage
  assignment

#### 5.2.2 Instant-Speed Defense (Classic Magic)

- Protect creatures or yourself with instants and abilities
- Counterspells, removal, and combat tricks reshape outcomes in real time

### 5.3 Combat Abilities (Vintage + Modern Highlights)

- **First strike / Double strike / Deathtouch / Lifelink / Menace / Reach**
- **Trample**: Excess damage carries to the defending player/planeswalker
- **Vigilance**: Doesn't tap to attack
- **Ward**: When this permanent becomes the target of an opponent's spell or
  ability, they must pay the listed cost or the spell/ability is countered
- Legacy keywords like **Flanking**, **Banding**, and **Rampage** may appear in
  curated cubes for nostalgia but are not core to new designs

### 5.4 Damage Resolution

- Combat damage is assigned and dealt simultaneously (first strike/double strike
  modify this)
- Damage assignment order matters when multiple blockers are involved
- Excess damage carries over only if the attacker has trample

## 6. Artifact and Equipment System (Classic Magic)

### 6.1 Equipment Basics

- **Permanents**: Equipment remain on the battlefield when cast
- **Attach**: Pay equip costs to attach to your creatures
- **Persistence**: Equipment stay in play if the creature dies
- **Activated abilities**: Many Equipment and artifacts have activated abilities

### 6.2 Equipment Types

- **Weapons**: Increase power and grant combat abilities
- **Armor**: Increase toughness and provide protection-like effects
- **Artifacts**: Utility, card flow, and mana production
- **Magical items**: Grant keywords or triggered effects

### 6.3 Strategic Equipment Use

- **Reliable value**: Equipment provide repeatable effects over time
- **Investment**: Balances tempo loss now for long-term advantage
- **Synergy**: Interacts with sacrifice, tokens, and warded threats
- **Allocation**: Weigh equip costs vs. holding up interaction

## 7. Advanced Mechanics and Keywords

### 7.1 MTG-Inspired Keywords (Evergreen)

- **Flying**: Can only be blocked by creatures with flying or reach
- **Trample**: Excess damage carries over to defender
- **Haste**: Can attack and tap the turn it enters
- **Vigilance**: Doesn't tap to attack
- **Ward**: Opponents must pay the listed cost to target or their spell/ability
  is countered
- **Menace / Reach / First strike / Deathtouch / Lifelink**: Modern combat
  staples that define interaction and racing

### 7.2 Vintage- and Power-Inspired Mechanics (Curated)

- **Storm**: Counts spells cast this turn; allowed but curated for power (use
  tournament restriction if needed)
- **Delve**: Exiles cards from graveyard to reduce costs; permitted but
  carefully curated
- **Cascade**: Reveals until you cast a cheaper spell; uses the modern rules
  that prevent unintended interactions with double-faced cards
- **Companion**: Uses the updated rule (pay 3 mana to put into hand)
- **Treasure**: Single-shot Treasure is common; **repeatable Treasure** is
  throttled/restricted to avoid "extra Moxen"
- **Investigate / Clue**: Token artifact with "2, Sacrifice: Draw a card"
- **Explore / Map**: Look at the top card; keep or bin, then optionally grow
  (creatures) or improve card quality (Maps)
- **Food**: Token artifact with "2, Sacrifice: You gain 3 life" for pacing and
  racing
- **Cases**: Enchantments with a condition to "solve" and upgrade their ongoing
  effect
- **Plot**: You may pay now and cast the plotted spell later **(limit: you may
  cast only one plotted spell each turn)**

### 7.3 Unique Hybrid Keywords (Forge Realm Originals)

- **Adaptable**: Cards with mode-like choices that favor flexibility over raw
  rate
- **Resonance**: Gets stronger when multiple cards share a trait in your
  graveyard
- **Tactical**: Grants bonuses based on board state thresholds (e.g., number of
  creatures, artifacts, or clues)
- **Momentum**: Builds counters or effects the longer it remains in play

## 8. Deck Construction

### 8.1 Basic Requirements (MTG Standard)

- **Constructed (Classic)**: Minimum **60** cards (no maximum); 4-copy limit per
  card name (basic lands excepted)
- **Blitz (40-card variant)**: Minimum **40** cards; 4-copy limit per card name
  (basic lands excepted)
- **Sideboard** (optional for match play): Up to **15** cards
- **1v1 default**: All rules assume head-to-head play

### 8.2 Strategic Considerations

- **Mana curve**: Balance early plays with impactful top-end
- **Land base**: Support color commitments and utility lands
- **Interaction suite**: Reserve slots for removal and counterplay
- **Win conditions**: Have a clear path to end the game
- **Token/alt-cost support**: If you run Bargain, Clues, Maps, or Food, include
  generators and payoffs deliberately

### 8.3 Format Variations

- **Constructed**: Build from your collection with the current legality list
- **Limited**: Draft or sealed (40-card decks recommended)
- **Blitz**: Faster 40-card format tuned for best-of-one or rapid matches
- **Classic**: Full 60-card strategic format with sideboards and longer games

## 9. Winning Strategy Principles

### 9.1 Resource Management Mastery

- **Card advantage**: Trade resources smartly; use Clues and Cases to keep cards
  flowing
- **Mana efficiency**: Curve out or hold up interaction as the matchup demands
- **Hand size**: Sequence to maximize your London Mulligan keeps
- **Equipment value**: Convert time into inevitability

### 9.2 Tempo and Pressure

- **Early aggression**: Punish stumbles while respecting Ward and instant-speed
  tricks
- **Board presence**: Translate resources into threats and leverage Explore/Map
  to hit land drops
- **Defensive timing**: Weigh removal vs. racing; Food can swing races by
  multiple turns
- **Finishing**: Close before opponents can unlock solved Cases or banked Plot
  cards

### 9.3 Adaptation and Response

- **Read the role**: Know when you're beatdown or control
- **Flexible lines**: Leave outs with modal/DFCs and adaptable effects
- **Stack dexterity**: Force awkward shields-down windows
- **Combat tricks**: Use Ward taxes and timing to strand opposing spells

## 10. Tournament and Competitive Play

### 10.1 Match Structure

- **Best of three** is standard
- **Round length**: 45 minutes typical
- **Sideboard**: Up to 15 cards; present the same deck after each match
- London Mulligan is used for all games

### 10.2 Rules Enforcement

- **Priority**: Announce and pass priority clearly
- **Card identification**: Reveal choices and face-up/face-down statuses as
  required
- **Sequencing**: Follow turn structure and stack rules precisely
- **Sportsmanship**: Respectful, competitive play is expected

### 10.3 Community Governance

- **Balance policy (guardrails)**:
  - **No Discover** cards or effects
  - **Treasure throttle**: Repeatable Treasure makers are restricted or
    disallowed; single-shot Treasure is fine
  - **Plot limit**: Each player may cast **one** plotted spell per turn
  - **Companion**: Uses the updated "pay 3 to hand" rule
  - **DFC/Cascade compliance**: Use modern rules for double-faced interactions

- **Open development**: Transparent updates and public changelogs
- **Player feedback**: Community input guides curation and restrictions
- **Fair access**: Open resources allow everyone to play
