## 2. Turn Structure and Timing

### 2.1 Complete Turn Sequence

Each turn consists of these phases in order:

#### 2.1.1 Beginning Phase

1. **Untap Step**
   - Active player untaps all permanents they control
   - This happens automatically and cannot be prevented
   - No player receives priority during this step

2. **Upkeep Step**
   - Resolve "at the beginning of your upkeep" triggered abilities
   - Active player receives priority first
   - Players may play instants and activate abilities

3. **Draw Step**
   - Active player draws exactly one card from their library
   - If the library is empty, the player loses the game
   - The first player skips their draw step on the first turn only

#### 2.1.2 First Main Phase

- Active player may play sorcery spells, creatures, artifacts, and enchantments
- Players may activate abilities and play instant spells
- Essence is generated and spent during this phase
- Phase ends when the active player chooses to proceed to combat

#### 2.1.3 Combat Phase

1. **Beginning of Combat Step**
   - Triggered abilities that trigger "at beginning of combat" trigger here
   - Players may play instants and activate abilities
   - Last chance to play effects before attackers are declared

2. **Declare Attackers Step**
   - Active player chooses which creatures they control will attack
   - Attacking creatures become tapped (unless they have vigilance)
   - "When [creature] attacks" abilities trigger
   - Defending player may play instants and activate abilities

3. **Declare Blockers Step**
   - Defending player assigns blockers to attacking creatures
   - Each blocking creature can block only one attacker
   - Multiple creatures may block a single attacker
   - "When [creature] blocks" or "becomes blocked" abilities trigger

4. **Combat Damage Step**
   - All combat damage is assigned and dealt simultaneously
   - Creatures deal damage equal to their power
   - Damage is dealt to blocking creatures or the defending player
   - "When [creature] deals combat damage" abilities trigger

5. **End of Combat Step**
   - "At end of combat" triggered abilities trigger
   - Attacking and blocking creatures are no longer attacking or blocking
   - Players may play instants and activate abilities

#### 2.1.4 Second Main Phase

- Identical rules to the first main phase

1. **End Step**
   - "At the beginning of the end step" and "at end of turn" abilities trigger
   - Players may play instants and activate abilities

2. **Cleanup Step**
   - Active player discards down to maximum hand size (7 cards)
   - Damage is removed from all creatures
   - "Until end of turn" effects end
   - Usually no player receives priority unless triggered abilities occur

### 2.2 Priority and Timing
