Ideal Magic is built for easy print-and-play sessions and smooth paper tracking.

## What You Need

### Essential Components

* **Decks**: Each player needs a **60+ card deck**
* **Life tracking**: Pen & paper or a d20 (start at **20 life**)
* **Counters & tokens**: Dice or markers for **+1/+1**, **lore** (Sagas), and **Quest** counters; tokens for **Clues**
* **Play area**: Table space for lands, battlefield, graveyard, and exile

### Optional but Helpful

* **Card sleeves** to protect prints
* **Extra dice** for Ward taxes, temporary effects, and turn markers
* **Reference sheet**: Use the Quick Reference at the end
* **Timer** for events (typical round: \~45 minutes)

---

## Game Overview

Spend **mana** to cast spells, develop your board, and win via combat and smart interaction.
**Goal**: Reduce your opponent from **20** life to **0**, or have them attempt to draw from an empty library.

---

## Pre-Game Setup

### Deck Requirements

* **Constructed**: Minimum **60** cards (no maximum); up to **4 copies** of any one card name (basics excepted)

### Starting the Game

1. **Shuffle** both decks thoroughly.
2. **Decide first**: Randomize (die roll/coin flip), then winner chooses to play or draw.
3. **Draw opening hands**: Each player draws **7**.
4. **Mulligans — London Mulligan**: You may mulligan any number of times. Each time, draw 7, then **put a number of cards equal to mulligans taken on the bottom** of your library in any order.
5. **Set life totals**: Both players start at **20**.
6. **First turn**: The player who goes first **skips their first draw step** only.

---

## Turn Structure (at a glance)

1. **Beginning Phase**

   * **Untap** → **Upkeep** (resolve “at the beginning of upkeep” triggers) → **Draw**
2. **Precombat Main**

   * Play **one land** (per turn), cast spells, activate abilities
3. **Combat Phase**

   * **Begin combat** → **Declare attackers** → **Declare blockers** → **Combat damage** → **End combat**
4. **Postcombat Main**
5. **End Step / Cleanup**

   * “At end step” triggers → discard to hand size (**7**) → remove damage, end “until end of turn” effects

**Priority & the Stack**: The active player gets priority first in each step/phase. Spells/abilities resolve **last-in, first-out**.

---

## Playing the Game

### Lands and Mana (no bookkeeping traps)

* **Play a land** during your main phase when the stack is empty (max one/turn).
* **Add mana** by **tapping** lands (and some artifacts/creatures). You add mana **only when you activate a mana ability**—there is **no automatic mana generation**.
* **Mana empties** at the **end of each step and phase** (no carrying over).
* Different spells require specific **colors** of mana (W/U/B/R/G); colorless is flexible but often less efficient.

### Casting Cards

* **Creatures/Artifacts/Enchantments/Sagas**: Cast in your main phases (stack empty).
* **Instants**: Any time you have priority.
* **Sorceries**: Your main phases, stack empty.
* After an instant or sorcery resolves, it goes to your **graveyard** (unless it says otherwise).

### Combat Basics

* **Attacking**: Tap your creatures to attack (unless they have vigilance).
* **Blocking**: Defending player assigns blockers; the attacker then sets the **damage order** if multiple blockers.
* **Damage**: Simultaneous (first strike/double strike change timing). **Trample** lets excess damage hit the defending player/planeswalker.
* **Ward**: If a permanent has **Ward — cost**, opponents must pay that cost to target it or the spell/ability is **countered**.

## The Ideal “Glue Suite” You’ll See Often

These popular, paper-clean mechanics appear frequently:

* **Scry N** / **Surveil N** — Smooth draws (top-deck filtering or graveyard selection).
* **Cycling \[cost]** — Discard to draw a card.
* **Kicker \[cost]** — Pay more for an upgraded effect.
* **Flashback \[cost]** — Cast from your graveyard, then exile it.
* **Foretell** — Pay {2} to set aside now; cast later for its foretell cost.
* **Adventure** — Cast the spell side first, then later cast the creature from exile.
* **Investigate** — Create a **Clue**: “{2}, Sacrifice: Draw a card.”
* **Landfall** — Triggers when a land enters under your control.
* **Sagas** — Add a lore counter as they enter and each precombat main; resolve that chapter’s effect.

**Also supported (appears regularly but in controlled doses):**
**Rebound**, **Surge**, **Raid**; **Buyback** (rare, conservatively costed); **Emerge** (small curated clusters).

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Not used in Ideal Magic**: Day/Night, Companion, Cipher, Venture/Dungeons, Cumulative Upkeep, Storm, Dredge, and other “free engine” loops. If a card references these, treat it as **not legal** in this format.

## Key Concepts (fast fundamentals)

### Mana & Efficiency

* Plan land drops and colors early.
* Tap only what you need; remember that mana **empties each step/phase**.
* Use Scry/Surveil/Cycling/Clues to avoid mana screw/flood.

### Card Types (quick)

* **Lands**: Your main mana sources.
* **Creatures**: Attack, block, use abilities; have **power/toughness**.
* **Instants/Sorceries**: One-time effects (instants at any time; sorceries only on your turn, main phase, stack empty).
* **Artifacts/Enchantments/Sagas**: Ongoing effects; Sagas tick with lore counters.

### Interaction & Timing

* Hold up instants for combat tricks or counterplay.
* **Ward** taxes opponents’ targeted interaction—bait it or pay it.
* Learn common windows: end step, after blocks, and shields-down moments.

## Sample Turn Walkthroughs

**Turn 1 (on the play)**

1. **Beginning**: Untap (nothing), **no draw** (first turn on the play).
2. **Main**: Play a land. Tap it to cast a **1-mana creature**.
3. **Combat**: None (summoning sickness).
4. **End**: Pass. *(Cards in hand: 6; Life: 20.)*

**Turn 3 (showing smoothing & tempo)**

1. **Beginning**: Untap, Upkeep (resolve triggers), Draw.
2. **Main**: Play a land (Landfall trigger, if any). Cast a **Foretell** spell face-down for {2}; then cast a **2-drop**.
3. **Combat**: Attack with your 1-drop; opponent blocks—use an **instant** to win combat.
4. **End**: If you Investigated this turn, you may keep the **Clue** for later or crack it on a future turn when you can spare {2}.

## Winning the Game

* **Primary**: Reduce your opponent to **0 life** (combat/spells/abilities).
* **Secondary**: Opponent tries to draw from an **empty library**.
* Some cards may have alternate wins; follow their text.

---

## Common Beginner Pitfalls (and fixes)

* **Too few lands/smoothing** → Add lands, **Cycling**, **Scry/Surveil**, or **Clues**.
* **All top-end** → Include impactful **2s/3s** to affect the board earlier.
* **Ignoring interaction** → Pack removal/counterplay; respect **Ward** costs.
* **Forgetting the stack** → Remember: last-in, first-out; pass priority clearly.
* **Floating mana across phases** → You **can’t**; mana empties each step/phase.

---

## Quick Reference

### Turn Order

**Beginning (Untap → Upkeep → Draw)** → **Main 1** → **Combat** → **Main 2** → **End**

### Essentials

* **Start**: 20 life, **7-card** hand
* **Mulligan**: **London** (draw 7 each time; bottom cards equal to mulligans taken)
* **Deck**: 60+ cards; up to 4 copies/card name
* **Hand size**: Max 7 at end step (discard down)
* **Lands per turn**: 1
* **Mana**: Added by tapping; **empties** at end of each step/phase

### Timing

* **Sorceries/Creatures/most Permanents**: Your main phase, stack empty
* **Instants**: Any time you have priority
* **Abilities**: As written; mana abilities don’t use the stack

### Mechanics You’ll See Often

**Kicker, Cycling, Flashback, Foretell, Adventure, Landfall, Sagas, Investigate**
Plus **Rebound, Surge, Raid** (with conservative **Buyback** and small **Emerge** clusters)
