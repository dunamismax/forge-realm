Forge Realm is designed for easy print-and-play tabletop sessions. Follow these simple steps to begin your first game.

## Components

- A deck of at least 60 Forge Realm cards
- Tokens or counters to track essence and effects
- A way to track life totals (20 per player)

## Setup

1. Each player shuffles their deck and draws seven cards.
2. Decide who goes first randomly.
3. Players start with 20 life and zero essence.

## Turn Sequence

1. **Draw Phase** – The active player draws a card.
2. **Main Phase** – Play cards, generate essence, and activate abilities.
3. **Combat Phase** – Declare attackers, resolve blocks, and deal damage.
4. **End Phase** – Resolve end-of-turn effects, then pass priority.

## Essence

Essence is the primary resource for casting spells and summoning creatures. Each card shows its essence cost and type requirements. Players may generate one essence per turn by tapping an appropriate source.

## Winning the Game

Reduce your opponent's life to zero or force them to draw from an empty library.
