Forge Realm is designed for easy print-and-play tabletop sessions. This guide will get you playing your first game in minutes.

## What You Need

### Essential Components

- **Decks**: Each player needs a 60-card deck
- **Life tracking**: Pen and paper, or d20 dice (start at 20 life)
- **Essence counters**: Tokens, coins, or dice to track essence
- **Effect markers**: Small tokens for temporary effects
- **Play area**: Table space for cards and tokens

### Optional but Helpful

- **Card sleeves**: Protect printed cards from wear
- **Dice**: d6 or d20 for random effects and life tracking
- **Reference sheet**: Quick rules summary (see below)
- **Timer**: For tournament or timed casual games

## Game Overview

Forge Realm is a strategic card game where players use **essence** (the game's mana system) to summon creatures, cast spells, and defeat their opponent.

**Goal**: Reduce your opponent's life from 20 to 0, or make them run out of cards.

## Pre-Game Setup

### Deck Requirements

- **Minimum 60 cards** (no maximum)
- **Maximum 4 copies** of any single card
- **Any combination** of card types (creatures, spells, artifacts, enchantments)

### Starting the Game

1. **Shuffle**: Both players shuffle their decks thoroughly
2. **Determine first player**: Flip a coin or roll dice
3. **Draw opening hand**: Each player draws 7 cards
4. **Mulligan option**: Players may shuffle their hand back and draw 6 cards instead (once per player)
5. **Set life totals**: Both players start at 20 life
6. **Begin**: The first player starts their turn (but skips their first draw step)

## Turn Structure

Each turn follows this sequence:

### 1. Beginning Phase

- **Untap**: Untap all your tapped cards
- **Draw**: Draw one card from your deck
- **Essence production**: Generate essence equal to your current essence sources

The player going first skips the draw step on their very first turn only.
{{% /alert %}}

### 2. Main Phase

This is where most of the action happens:

#### Playing Cards

- **Pay essence costs**: Spend essence to play cards from your hand
- **Summon creatures**: Put creature cards onto the battlefield
- **Cast spells**: Play instant or sorcery spells for immediate effects
- **Play artifacts/enchantments**: Put permanent effects into play

#### Essence System

- **Essence sources**: Some cards provide ongoing essence generation
- **Spending essence**: Use accumulated essence to pay for card costs
- **Essence types**: Different cards may require specific essence types
- **Banking essence**: Unspent essence carries over between phases (but not turns)

### 3. Combat Phase

Attack your opponent with creatures:

#### Combat Steps

1. **Declare attackers**: Choose which creatures attack
2. **Declare blockers**: Defending player assigns blockers
3. **Resolve combat**: Calculate damage and apply effects
4. **Damage resolution**: Apply damage to creatures and players

#### Combat Rules

- **Attacking**: Tap creatures to attack (they can't block)
- **Blocking**: Untapped creatures can block attacking creatures
- **Damage**: Attacking creatures deal damage to blockers or the defending player
- **Creature death**: Creatures die when damage equals or exceeds their toughness

### 4. End Phase

- **Resolve end-of-turn effects**: Handle any "at end of turn" abilities
- **Hand size**: If you have more than 7 cards, discard down to 7
- **Pass turn**: The other player begins their turn

## Key Concepts

### Essence Management

Essence is your primary resource:

- **Generation**: Played from specific cards or abilities
- **Spending**: Used to pay costs for spells and abilities
- **Efficiency**: Balancing essence production with powerful effects
- **Timing**: Some abilities require essence to be spent at specific times

### Card Types

#### Creatures

- **Combat**: Can attack and block
- **Stats**: Power (attack damage) and toughness (damage needed to destroy)
- **Abilities**: Many have special powers or effects
- **Summoning**: Generally cost essence to put into play

#### Spells

- **Instants**: Can be played any time you could take an action
- **Sorceries**: Can only be played during your main phase
- **Effects**: Immediate impact, then go to discard pile

#### Permanents

- **Artifacts**: Equipment, tools, or magical items
- **Enchantments**: Ongoing magical effects
- **Persistence**: Remain in play until destroyed or removed

### Combat Mechanics

#### Basic Combat

1. **Choose attackers**: Select which creatures attack
2. **Opponent blocks**: Defending player assigns blockers
3. **Calculate damage**: Compare power vs. toughness
4. **Apply results**: Damage carries over to players if unblocked

#### Advanced Combat

- **Multiple blockers**: One attacker can be blocked by multiple creatures
- **Damage assignment**: Attacking player chooses how to distribute damage
- **Combat abilities**: Some creatures have special combat powers
- **Combat tricks**: Instant spells can change combat outcomes

## Winning Conditions

### Primary Victory

- **Reduce opponent to 0 life**: Most common win condition
- **Deal damage**: Through combat, spells, or abilities

### Secondary Victory

- **Opponent draws from empty deck**: They lose immediately
- **Special card effects**: Some cards provide alternate win conditions

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Deck Building

- **Too many expensive cards**: Include cheap, early-game options
- **No essence sources**: Ensure adequate essence generation
- **Unfocused strategy**: Build around a clear game plan

### Gameplay

- **Poor essence management**: Don't overspend early
- **Ignoring card advantage**: Consider long-term resources
- **Predictable play**: Vary your strategies
- **Forgetting abilities**: Read cards carefully and use all available effects

## Sample Turn Walkthrough

**Turn 1 Example:**

1. **Beginning**: Untap (nothing tapped), draw card, generate essence
2. **Main Phase**: Play an essence-generating artifact for 1 essence
3. **Combat**: No creatures to attack with
4. **End**: Pass turn (hand: 6 cards, life: 20, essence: 0)

**Turn 3 Example:**

1. **Beginning**: Untap artifact, draw card, generate 2 essence
2. **Main Phase**: Play a 3-essence creature, leaving 1 essence
3. **Combat**: Creature was just played, can't attack yet
4. **End**: Pass turn (hand: 5 cards, life: 20, essence: 1)

## Quick Reference

### Turn Order

1. Beginning (untap, draw, generate essence)
2. Main phase (play cards, use abilities)
