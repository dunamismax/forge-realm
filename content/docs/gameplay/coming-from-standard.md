## Deck Building Evolution

### From Standard to Eternal Thinking

**Standard mindset:**

- "What's legal in the current format?"
- "What's good against this week's meta?"
- "Should I buy this card before rotation?"

**Ideal Magic mindset:**

- "What's the optimal build for this strategy?"
- "How does this perform against the established meta?"
- "This investment will last indefinitely"

### Expanded Deck Building Options

**More tools, same disciplines:**

**In Standard:** Limited by recent printings
**In Ideal Magic:** Best version of each effect across Magic's history

**Examples:**

- **Counterspells:** Choose from the best 2-3 mana counters ever printed
- **Removal:** Perfect removal suite without being oppressive
- **Threats:** Efficient creatures without broken text
- **Card draw:** Optimal selection without overwhelming engines

### Mana Base Improvements

**Standard mana bases you know:**

- Shock lands + Check lands
- Fast lands + Slow lands  
- Basic lands for budget builds

**Ideal Magic mana bases:**

- **Best fixing ever printed** (within power level guidelines)
- **No ABUR duals** - maintains accessible power level
- **Pain lands, Check lands, Fast lands** as needed
- **Utility lands** without oppressive lock pieces
