|---------|-------------|
| **"Turn 4 rule"** - combo/aggro pressure | **"20 life matters"** - every turn counts |
| **Linear strategies dominate** | **Interactive gameplay prioritized** |
| **Some oppressive lock pieces** | **Ward over Hexproof** for fair interaction |
| **Power level varies wildly** | **Consistent, curated power level** |

## Card Pool Comparison

### Power Level Philosophy

**Modern's approach:** "Powerful cards legal until proven broken"
**Ideal Magic's approach:** "Curated powerful cards that create great gameplay"

**Examples of power level curation:**

**Efficient Threats (Modern → Ideal Magic):**

```
Tarmogoyf → Ward-based efficient creatures
Snapcaster Mage → Creatures with Adventure/Flashback synergy
Death's Shadow → Aggressive creatures with interactive counterplay
```

**Interaction Spells:**

```
Path to Exile → Premium removal without oppressive ramp
Counterspell → Optimal permission spells for fair games
Lightning Bolt → Efficient damage that doesn't enable unfair combos
```

**Value Engines:**

```
Jace, the Mind Sculptor → Card selection with Scry/Surveil effects
Dark Confidant → Investigate engines for sustainable advantage
Bloodbraid Elf → Adventure creatures for guaranteed value
```

### Mana Base Evolution

**Modern mana bases you know:**

- Fetch lands + Shock lands for perfect fixing
- Fast lands for aggro decks
- Pain lands for budget builds
- Utility lands with powerful effects

**Ideal Magic mana bases:**

- **Fetch lands available** where appropriate for deck construction
- **Check lands and pain lands** for consistent fixing
- **Utility lands** without oppressive effects (no Wasteland effects)
- **Smooth mana curves** supported by Cycling and Scry

---

## Metagame Translation

### From Linear to Interactive

**Modern metagame pressures:**

- **Combo decks** demand specific answers
- **Linear aggro** races through interaction
- **Prison strategies** shut down entire approaches
- **Big mana** outscales fair strategies

**Ideal Magic metagame dynamics:**

- **Board-centric gameplay** rewards interaction
- **Ward mechanics** create fair protection
- **Scaling strategies** compete on mana efficiency
- **Value engines** provide incremental advantage

### Archetype Balance

**Modern rock-paper-scissors:**

```
Combo beats Midrange
Aggro beats Combo  
Control beats Aggro
(With many exceptions and corner cases)
```

**Ideal Magic strategic spectrum:**

```
Aggro ←→ Midrange ←→ Control
All positions have counterplay and adaptation options
```

## Deck Building Evolution

### From Modern to Ideal Magic Thinking

**Modern deck building:**

- "How do I win fastest/most unfairly?"
- "What stops my opponent from winning?"
- "Can I goldfish consistently on turn 3-4?"

**Ideal Magic deck building:**

- "How do I create sustainable advantage?"
- "What's my plan against different board states?"
- "How do I interact meaningfully with opponents?"

### Synergy vs. Power Level

**Modern approach:** Find the most powerful synergies legal in the format
**Ideal Magic approach:** Build synergies that create interactive gameplay

**Examples:**

**Card Selection Engines:**

- **Modern:** Serum Visions, Opt, Faithless Looting
- **Ideal Magic:** Scry, Cycling, Investigate for smooth selection

**Threat Packages:**

- **Modern:** Most efficient threats available
- **Ideal Magic:** Efficient threats with built-in value (Adventure, Ward)

**Interaction Suites:**

- **Modern:** Hate cards for specific strategies  
- **Ideal Magic:** Broad interaction that handles multiple strategies
