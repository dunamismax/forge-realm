  Ways to play Ideal Magic for different group sizes and goals—built on classic
  foundations with modern, paper-friendly upgrades.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
All formats use the **Ideal Magic** philosophy: board-first gameplay, broad interaction,
and low bookkeeping. The **Ideal banlist** applies to every format (see Comprehensive
Rules §7).

## Constructed Formats

### Ideal Constructed (Default)

* **Card pool**: All Magic: The Gathering cards that are legal in Ideal Magic format and comply with the banlist/policy.
* **Rotation**: **None**. Build and refine indefinitely.
* **Design intent**: Healthy metagame where the “glue suite” (Kicker, Cycling, Flashback, Foretell, Adventure, Landfall, Sagas, Investigate) plus Rebound/Surge/Raid drive agency and interaction.
* **Governance**: Central updates may add or remove cards from legality to preserve format health; Buyback/Emerge appear only under policy constraints.

### Eternal (Open)

* **Card pool**: Same as Ideal Constructed **plus** any sanctioned cameo reprints/supplementals tagged “Eternal-legal.”
* **Rotation**: **None**.
* **Intent**: Broader sandbox for enfranchised players without violating paper clarity.
* **Note**: No restricted list by default; if a specific card proves format-warping, it may be banned rather than restricted.

### Budget (Commons+)

* **Card pool**: Organizer-defined rarity cutoff (e.g., commons-only or common+uncommon from Ideal sets).
* **Intent**: Low-cost entry with the same core rules and banlist.
* **Tip**: Favor mechanics with clean paper tracking (Clues/Scry/Cycling/Landfall) at lower rarities.

---

## Limited Formats

All Limited formats use **40+** card decks, **20** life, and the **London Mulligan**.

### Draft

* **Players**: 6–8 ideal (4+ works).
* **Product**: Ideal Magic boosters (set-specific).
* **Build**: Draft, then construct a **40+** card deck from your pool; basic lands as needed.
* **Design notes**: Each set features 2–3 “glue suite” mechanics plus a signature (e.g., Raid/Surge) for clear archetypes and low bookkeeping.

### Sealed

* **Players**: Any number.
* **Product**: **6** boosters per player (recommended baseline).
* **Build**: Construct a **40+** card deck from your pool; basic lands as needed.
* **Experience**: Midrange-friendly with ample smoothing (Scry/Clues/Cycling).

### Cube (Ideal)

* **Players**: 2–8.
* **Pool**: Custom, curated pool using Ideal-legal cards (and organizer-approved cameos).
* **Guidelines**:

  * Keep tracking visible (counters/tokens on permanents).
  * Prioritize the glue suite and clean interaction (Ward over hexproof; broad removal).
  * Use Buyback/Emerge sparingly and at conservative rates.

---

## Casual & Multiplayer

* **House Rules**: Encourage local twists that keep tracking on-board.
* **Multiplayer Free-for-All (3–6 players)**:

  * **20 life** baseline (organizers may set 30 for longer games).
  * Turn order clockwise; attack any opponent; last player standing wins.
  * Politics welcome, bookkeeping not—favor Clues/Sagas/Landfall over off-board mini-games.
* **Singleton / Highlander**: 1 copy of each card (basics excepted), Ideal banlist applies.
* **Learn-to-Play Packs / Jumpstart-style**: Prebuilt half-decks using the glue suite for fast onboarding.

---

## Organizer Options (recommended defaults)

* **Match structure**: Best-of-three, 45-minute rounds, 5-minute sideboarding.
* **Tiebreakers**: Standard extra turns (Turn 0–5), then life total if needed.
* **Tokens & counters**: Provide Clue tokens and generic counters at the table.
* **Legality sheet**: Post the current banlist/policy summary at registration.
* **Local Additions**: If testing cameo cards/mechanics, clearly mark the event as **Eternal (Open)**.
