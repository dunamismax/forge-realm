This guide provides step-by-step instructions to print Forge Realm cards at home.

## 1. Prepare Files
- Download card images or PDFs from the project repository.
- Ensure images are at least 300 DPI for clear prints.

## 2. Printer Settings
- Set paper size to A4 or Letter based on your region.
- Choose "Actual Size" or 100% scaling to maintain dimensions.
- Select the highest quality print setting available.

## 3. Cardstock and Cutting
- Use cardstock between 280â€“330 GSM.
- After printing, allow ink to dry completely before cutting.
- Use a paper cutter or sharp scissors for clean edges.

## 4. Sleeving
- Place printed cards into standard trading card sleeves.
- For added rigidity, insert a common card as backing.

## 5. Storage
- Store cards in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to preserve their power.
