- Optional: Corner rounder, laminator, or card backing material

### Software Requirements

- PDF viewer (Adobe Acrobat Reader recommended)
- Image editing software (optional, for customization)
- Printer driver software updated to latest version

## Step 1: Download Card Files

### File Formats Available

- **Proxy Templates**: Pre-designed templates for creating Magic card proxies
- **Blank Templates**: Customizable templates for any Magic card
- **Legal Card Lists**: Text files for importing into various platforms
- **Sample Proxy PDFs**: Example proxy layouts for different card types

### Proxy Resource Access

1. Download proxy templates and resources from the format guides
2. Select appropriate templates for the cards you want to proxy
3. Choose format based on your printing needs:
   - **Beginners**: Use pre-made proxy templates for easiest setup
   - **Advanced users**: Blank templates for custom proxy creation
4. Verify template quality (should be 300 DPI minimum for best results)

## Step 2: Prepare Your Printer

### Inkjet Printer Setup

1. **Clean print heads** using printer maintenance utilities
2. **Check ink levels** and replace cartridges if low
3. **Perform nozzle check** to ensure even ink distribution
4. **Calibrate color settings** if your printer supports it

### Laser Printer Setup

1. **Clean the paper path** to prevent toner smudging
2. **Check toner levels** and replace cartridges if low
3. **Adjust fuser temperature** for heavy cardstock (if available)
4. **Enable manual feed mode** for better cardstock handling

### Universal Printer Settings

- **Paper Size**: A4 (210×297mm) or US Letter (8.5×11")
- **Scaling**: 100% / "Actual Size" / "Do Not Scale"
- **Print Quality**: Highest available (1200 DPI or better)
- **Paper Type**: Heavy/Cardstock (adjust based on your paper weight)
- **Color Management**: sRGB color space
- **Margins**: Minimum or borderless if supported

## Step 3: Choose and Prepare Cardstock

### Recommended Cardstock Specifications

- **Weight**: 280-330 GSM (ideal: 300-310 GSM)
- **Thickness**: 0.3-0.4mm for professional feel
- **Finish Options**:
  - **Matte**: Reduces glare, easier to read in various lighting
  - **Satin**: Balance between durability and readability
  - **Gloss**: Enhanced colors but more glare and fingerprints

### Brand Recommendations

- **Neenah Cardstock**: Professional grade, consistent quality
- **Hammermill Color Copy**: Good budget option, widely available
- **Canon Photo Paper Plus**: Excellent for photo-quality prints
- **Epson Premium Presentation Paper**: Ideal for EcoTank printers

### Paper Preparation

1. **Acclimate paper** to room temperature for 24 hours before printing
2. **Store flat** to prevent curling and feeding issues
3. **Fan pages** before loading to separate static-bonded sheets
4. **Load small batches** (5-10 sheets) to prevent jams

## Step 4: Test Print and Calibration

### Initial Test Print

1. Print **one page only** for your first attempt
2. Use a **single card design** to test settings
3. **Measure printed dimensions** with a ruler:
   - Standard card size: 63mm × 88mm (2.48" × 3.46")
   - Allow 2-3mm bleed area around each card
4. **Check color accuracy** against digital files
5. **Inspect print quality** for:
   - Sharp text and line art
   - Smooth color gradients
   - No banding or streaking
   - Proper ink saturation

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Cards too small/large**: Adjust scaling in printer settings
- **Blurry text**: Increase print quality, check alignment
- **Color mismatch**: Calibrate monitor and printer color profiles
- **Paper jams**: Reduce batch size, check paper path
- **Ink smudging**: Allow more drying time, reduce ink density

## Step 5: Full Print Run

### Printing Best Practices

1. **Print in small batches** (1-2 sheets at a time)
2. **Allow 30-60 seconds** between print jobs for cooling
3. **Monitor print quality** throughout the run
4. **Handle printed sheets carefully** to avoid smudging
5. **Stack printed sheets face-up** with separator sheets

### Drying and Curing

- **Inkjet prints**: Allow 15-30 minutes drying time
- **Laser prints**: Allow 5-10 minutes cooling time
- **Avoid stacking** wet prints to prevent transfer
- **Use fans** to accelerate drying in humid conditions

## Step 6: Cutting and Finishing

### Cutting Tools and Techniques

#### Paper Cutter Method (Recommended)

1. **Use a sharp guillotine cutter** with measurement guides
2. **Cut in batches** of 3-5 sheets maximum
3. **Score lightly first**, then complete the cut
4. **Check alignment** frequently using printed guides
5. **Replace blades regularly** for clean cuts

#### Craft Knife Method

1. **Use a metal ruler** and cutting mat
2. **Score multiple light passes** rather than one heavy cut
3. **Keep blade perpendicular** to prevent beveled edges
4. **Change blades frequently** for optimal sharpness

#### Precision Scissors Method

1. **Use sharp craft scissors** with fine points
2. **Cut slowly and steadily** following printed guidelines
3. **Start from corners** and work toward center
4. **Check dimensions frequently** with a ruler

### Finishing Touches

- **Corner rounding**: Use a corner rounder for professional appearance
- **Edge sealing**: Light application of clear coat spray for durability
- **Surface protection**: Consider lamination for heavily-used cards

## Step 7: Quality Control and Sleeving

### Quality Inspection

- **Check dimensions**: Each card should measure 63mm × 88mm
- **Inspect edges**: Look for clean, straight cuts
- **Verify print quality**: Text should be sharp and readable
- **Color consistency**: Compare cards for uniform coloring
- **Surface defects**: Check for scratches, smudges, or damage

### Sleeving Options

- **Standard card sleeves**: 66mm × 91mm clear sleeves
- **Premium sleeves**: Thicker material for tournament play
- **Matte sleeves**: Reduce glare and improve shuffling
- **Backing cards**: Insert old trading cards for rigidity

### Sleeving Process

1. **Clean cards** with dry cloth if needed
2. **Insert cards face-first** into sleeves
3. **Remove air bubbles** by pressing gently
4. **Check fit**: Cards should move freely but not rattle
5. **Add backing cards** if using thin cardstock

## Step 8: Storage and Organization

### Short-term Storage

- **Use deck boxes** for active play sets
- **Keep sleeved** to prevent damage
- **Store vertically** to prevent bending
- **Avoid extreme temperatures** and humidity

### Long-term Storage

- **Use storage boxes** with dividers
- **Include silica gel packets** in humid environments
- **Store in dark locations** to prevent UV fading
- **Keep temperature stable** (18-22°C ideal)
- **Check periodically** for signs of damage or warping

## Advanced Tips and Techniques

### Color Management

- **Calibrate your monitor** for accurate color representation
- **Use printer color profiles** specific to your paper type
- **Print color swatches** to test accuracy
- **Maintain consistent ambient lighting** when comparing colors

### Cost Optimization

- **Print in larger batches** to reduce per-card cost
- **Use draft mode** for test prints only
- **Buy paper in bulk** for better pricing
- **Consider refillable ink systems** for high-volume printing

### Professional Finishing

- **Use a laminator** for maximum durability
- **Apply UV protective coating** for long-term storage
- **Consider foil stamping** for special cards
- **Use textured cardstock** for unique tactile feel
