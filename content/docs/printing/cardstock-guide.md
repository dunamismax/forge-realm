  Choose the right paper for professional-quality cards.

Card quality and durability depend on your paper choice. For professional results:

- **Thickness**: Use cardstock between 280â€“330 GSM for a professional feel.
- **Finish**: Matte finish reduces glare while gloss enhances colors.
- **Sleeving**: If using card sleeves, 200 GSM paper with a backing card can also work.

Always run a test print before large batches to ensure your printer handles the cardstock properly.
