## Understanding Cardstock Specifications

### GSM (Grams per Square Meter)

- **350+ GSM**: May cause printer feeding issues

### Thickness Measurements

- **0.25-0.30mm**: Light cardstock, needs backing for rigidity
- **0.30-0.35mm**: Standard cardstock, good for most applications
- **0.35-0.40mm**: Heavy cardstock, premium feel
- **0.40mm+**: Very thick, may not fit in standard sleeves
