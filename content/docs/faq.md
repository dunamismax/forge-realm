## General Questions

### What is Ideal Magic?

Ideal Magic is the perfect Magic: The Gathering experience—a carefully curated format that features only the best mechanics from Magic's history while completely removing the problematic ones. This is Magic as it was meant to be: pure, balanced, and focused on interactive gameplay.

### How is Ideal Magic different from regular Magic?

**Best mechanics only**: Features beloved mechanics like Kicker, Cycling, Flashback, Adventure, Landfall, and Sagas while completely banning Storm, Dredge, Companion, Day/Night, and other format-warping mechanics. **Board-first gameplay**: Emphasizes interactive, visible game states with low bookkeeping and no hidden tracking. **Perfect balance**: Community-curated card pool ensures optimal gameplay without oppressive strategies. **Pure MTG experience**: Classic Magic foundations with modern paper-friendly design.

### Is Ideal Magic really free?

Yes! The format rules and guidelines are completely free.
You only pay for actual Magic cards from your preferred vendor, or optionally:

- Paper and ink for printing proxies for playtesting
- Optional premium materials (special cardstock, sleeves)
- Professional printing services for proxy cards

### When will cards be available?

Ideal Magic is a **format and philosophy** rather than new cards. The community is currently curating the perfect card pool from Magic's existing history, featuring only the best and most balanced cards with our approved mechanics. Join our Discord to participate in the curation process and help build the ultimate Magic experience.

## Gameplay Questions

### How long does a typical game take?

- **Casual games**: 20-30 minutes

### How many players can play?

Ideal Magic supports:

- **2 players** (primary competitive format)
- **3-4 players** (multiplayer variant rules)

are available for reference during games.

### Can I play online or digitally?

Ideal Magic can be played on any platform that supports Magic: The Gathering, as it uses existing Magic cards. Our community maintains lists of legal cards for online platforms like Magic Online, Arena (when applicable), and Cockatrice. However, our focus is on optimizing the physical tabletop experience.
