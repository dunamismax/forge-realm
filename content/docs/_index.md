## What is Forge Realm?

Forge Realm TCG is a fully open-source trading card game built for tabletop play. The project focuses on democratizing trading card games through transparent development, community governance, unrestricted print-and-play access, and no artificial scarcity.

## Core Principles

- **Complete transparency** – all decisions made publicly
- **Democratic governance** – community votes drive direction
- **Free accessibility** – print-and-play for everyone
- **No artificial scarcity** – all cards available to all players
