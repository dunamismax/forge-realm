## What is Ideal Magic?

Ideal Magic TCG preserves Magic's strategic depth through open-source development. Built on Legacy and Vintage foundations, it delivers the classic Magic experience without corporate gatekeeping, artificial scarcity, or access barriers.

## Core Principles

- **Complete transparency** – all decisions made publicly with full community visibility
- **Democratic governance** – community votes determine game evolution and balance changes  
- **Universal access** – unrestricted print-and-play for everyone
- **No artificial scarcity** – every card available to every player
