## What is Ideal Magic?

It's the Magic you remember at its best—sharp, interactive, and endlessly replayable—refined until every decision feels clean in the hand and vivid on the table. The rules step out of the way. The drama stays.

You start at twenty life with the London Mulligan, and the game meets you halfway: scry, surveil, cycling, and clues smooth rough draws without erasing variance. Lands remain the heartbeat—one a turn, tap for color, plan your curve—and the color pie still shapes every story you tell.

## Core Philosophy

- **The beloved "glue suite"** – Kicker, Cycling, Flashback, Foretell, Adventure, Landfall, Sagas, Investigate—mechanics that make choices sing
- **No sand in the gears** – Storm, Dredge, Companion, Day/Night, and off-board tracking mechanics have been cut completely  
- **Board-first & paper-friendly** – every moving part lives where you can see it: counters on permanents, tokens on the battlefield
- **Ward over Hexproof** – interaction with a fair tax, not a wall; choices over bookkeeping, complexity in decisions not administration
