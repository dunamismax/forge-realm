## The Future of Magic

Ideal Magic preserves Magic's golden age while democratizing access through open-source development. We champion the strategic depth and timeless mechanics that made Magic legendary, free from corporate restrictions and artificial scarcity.

Built on Legacy and Vintage's proven foundation, enhanced only where the community votes for meaningful improvement. No chase rares. No gatekeeping. Just pure strategic gameplay.
