## Magic at Its Absolute Best

You start at twenty life with the London Mulligan, and the game meets you halfway: scry, surveil, cycling, and clues smooth rough draws without erasing variance. Lands remain the heartbeat—one a turn, tap for color, plan your curve—and the color pie still shapes every story you tell.

Interaction is honest and ever-present. **Ward, not hexproof**, is the default shield: a small toll that invites real counterplay rather than shutting it off. Play is board-first and paper-friendly—every moving part lives where you can see it.

We built this from the beloved **"glue suite"**—**Kicker, Cycling, Flashback, Foretell, Adventure, Landfall, Sagas, Investigate**—plus **Rebound, Surge, and Raid** that celebrate perfect turns without breaking them. We cut the mechanics that asked you to track ghosts or broke the pace: **Storm, Dredge, Companion, Day/Night, Dungeons, Cipher, Cumulative Upkeep**.

**This is Magic as it was meant to be**—familiar, but lighter in the hand. The best parts aren't rare moments—they're the default state of play. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KQTY8DfY) to experience it yourself.
