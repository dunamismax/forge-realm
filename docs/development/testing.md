# Testing Guidelines

Since this repository contains documentation and printable assets, testing focuses on content accuracy and file integrity.

## Spell Check and Linting
- Run a spell checker on Markdown files before submitting changes.
- Ensure links are valid and relative paths resolve correctly.

## Playtesting
- When proposing rule changes or new cards, include notes from physical playtests.
- Use the Discord server to coordinate group testing sessions.

## Future Automation
- As digital tools are introduced, automated tests will verify game logic and data consistency. These will be documented here when available.
