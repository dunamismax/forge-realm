# Testing Guidelines

This repository focuses on documentation and assets, so testing emphasizes content accuracy and file integrity.

## Spell Check and Linting
- Run a spell checker on Markdown files before submitting changes.
- Ensure links are valid and relative paths resolve correctly.

## Playtesting  
- Include physical playtest notes when proposing rule changes or new cards.
- Coordinate group testing sessions through Discord.

## Future Automation
- As digital tools are introduced, automated tests will verify game logic and data consistency. These will be documented here when available.
