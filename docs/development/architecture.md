# Project Architecture

Forge Realm maintains a clean documentation-focused structure for core game materials and assets:

```
root/
├── docs/           # Gameplay rules, printing guides, development notes
├── assets/         # Logos, card templates, and artwork
└── README.md       # Project overview and links
```

Community discussion and collaboration happens on Discord rather than in repository folders to maintain focus on documentation and game assets. Future digital tools (Discord bot, web client) will be developed in separate repositories.
