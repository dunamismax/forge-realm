# Project Architecture

Forge Realm is currently a documentation-focused repository. The structure is organized as follows:

```
root/
├── docs/           # Gameplay rules, printing guides, development notes
├── community/      # Meeting notes, proposals, and voting records
├── assets/         # Logos, card templates, and artwork
└── README.md       # Project overview and links
```

Future digital tools (such as a Discord bot or web client) will be developed in separate repositories to keep this space focused on tabletop play materials.
