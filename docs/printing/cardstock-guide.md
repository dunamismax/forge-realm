# Cardstock Guide

Card feel and durability depend on the paper you choose. For best results:

- **Thickness**: Use cardstock between 280â€“330 GSM for a professional feel.
- **Finish**: Matte finish reduces glare while gloss enhances colors.
- **Sleeving**: If using card sleeves, 200 GSM paper with a backing card can also work.

Always test a single sheet before large print runs to ensure your printer handles the chosen stock.
