# Recommended Printers

Home printing quality can vary greatly by printer. The following models are commonly praised for card printing:

## Inkjet

- **Epson EcoTank Series** – Low running costs and vibrant colors.
- **Canon PIXMA Series** – Excellent color accuracy and photo quality.

## Laser

- **Brother HL-L3290CDW** – Reliable color laser with crisp text and graphics.
- **HP Color LaserJet Pro M255dw** – Fast printing with good color reproduction.

When choosing a printer, ensure it supports heavy cardstock (at least 200 GSM) and has a manual feed tray to prevent jams.
