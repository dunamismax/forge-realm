# Quick Start Guide

Forge Realm is designed for easy print-and-play tabletop sessions. This guide will walk you through the essentials so you can start playing immediately.

## Components
- A deck of at least 60 Forge Realm cards
- Tokens or counters to track essence and effects
- A way to track life totals (20 per player)

## Setup
1. Each player shuffles their deck and draws seven cards.
2. Decide who goes first randomly.
3. Players start with 20 life and zero essence.

## Turn Sequence
1. **Draw Phase** – The active player draws a card.
2. **Main Phase** – Play cards, generate essence, and activate abilities.
3. **Combat Phase** – Declare attackers, resolve blocks, and deal damage.
4. **End Phase** – Resolve end-of-turn effects, then pass priority.

## Essence
Essence is the resource used to play cards. Each card shows the amount and type of essence required. Players may generate one essence of any type once per turn by tapping a card or ability that produces it.

## Winning the Game
Reduce your opponent's life total to zero or force them to draw from an empty deck.
