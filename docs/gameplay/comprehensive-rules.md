# Comprehensive Rules

This document defines the full ruleset for Forge Realm. It supplements the Quick Start Guide with detailed timing and interaction information.

## 1. Game Concepts
- **Card**: A game piece representing spells, units, or permanents.
- **Deck**: A minimum of 60 cards. Players may have up to four copies of any card unless otherwise specified.
- **Zone**: Area of the game where a card can exist (deck, hand, battlefield, discard).
- **Essence**: Resource used to pay costs. Essence types are elemental alignments of the realm.

## 2. Turn Structure
1. **Start Phase**
   - Untap: All tapped cards you control become untapped.
   - Upkeep: Resolve any "at the beginning of upkeep" effects.
2. **Draw Phase**
   - Active player draws one card.
3. **Main Phase**
   - Players may play cards, generate essence, and activate abilities.
4. **Combat Phase**
   - **Declare Attackers**: Active player chooses which units attack.
   - **Declare Blockers**: Defending player assigns blockers.
   - **Damage**: Combat damage is dealt simultaneously.
5. **End Phase**
   - Resolve end-of-turn triggers, then discard down to hand size if required.

## 3. Playing Cards
- To play a card, announce it and pay its essence cost.
- Card types include Units, Spells, Relics, and Events.
- Unless stated otherwise, cards enter the battlefield in an untapped state.

## 4. Essence
- Players may generate one essence per turn by tapping a source they control.
- Unused essence empties at the end of each phase.
- Some abilities may produce additional essence or allow storage across turns.

## 5. Stack and Priority
- When a spell or ability is played, it goes on the stack.
- Players receive priority to respond before the top object resolves.
- The stack resolves in last-in, first-out order.

## 6. Combat
- Units assigned as blockers remain tapped until the end of combat.
- A blocked unit deals damage to the blocking unit; unblocked units deal damage to the defending player.

## 7. Winning the Game
- A player loses when their life total reaches zero or they attempt to draw from an empty deck.
- Certain cards may provide alternate win conditions as specified in their text.

## 8. Keywords
- **Flying**: Can only be blocked by units with Flying.
- **Haste**: Can attack the turn it enters the battlefield.
- **Guard**: Must be blocked if able.
- Additional keywords will be documented as sets are released.

## 9. Mulligans
- Players may mulligan by shuffling their hand into their deck and drawing a new hand with one fewer card.
