This document defines the full ruleset for Forge Realm. It supplements the Quick Start Guide with detailed timing and interaction information.

## 1. Game Concepts

- **Card**: A game piece representing spells, creatures, or permanents
- **Deck**: Minimum 60 cards. Players may include up to four copies of any card unless restricted
- **Zone**: Game area where cards exist (library, hand, battlefield, graveyard)
- **Essence**: Primary resource for casting spells. Essence comes in five elemental types aligned with the planes of existence

## 2. Turn Structure

1. **Start Phase**
   - Untap: All tapped cards you control become untapped.
   - Upkeep: Resolve any "at the beginning of upkeep" effects.
2. **Draw Phase**
   - Active player draws one card.
3. **Main Phase**
   - Players may play cards, generate essence, and activate abilities.
4. **Combat Phase**
   - **Declare Attackers**: Active player chooses which creatures attack.
   - **Declare Blockers**: Defending player assigns blockers.
   - **Damage**: Combat damage is dealt simultaneously.
5. **End Phase**
   - Resolve end-of-turn triggers, then discard down to hand size if required.

## 3. Playing Cards

- To play a card, announce it and pay its essence cost.
- Card types include Creatures, Instants, Sorceries, Artifacts, and Enchantments.
- Unless stated otherwise, cards enter the battlefield in an untapped state.

## 4. Essence

- Players may generate one essence per turn by tapping a source they control.
- Unused essence empties at the end of each phase.
- Some abilities may produce additional essence or allow storage across turns.

## 5. Stack and Priority

- When a spell or ability is played, it goes on the stack.
- Players receive priority to respond before the top object resolves.
- The stack resolves in last-in, first-out order.

## 6. Combat

- Creatures assigned as blockers remain tapped until end of combat.
- Blocked creatures deal damage to blocking creatures; unblocked creatures deal damage to defending player.

## 7. Winning the Game

- A player loses when their life total reaches zero or they attempt to draw from an empty deck.
- Certain cards may provide alternate victory conditions as specified in their text.

## 8. Keywords

- **Haste**: Can attack immediately upon entering play
- **Guard**: Must be blocked if able (like a stalwart defender holding the line)
