# Repository Structure

Forge Realm maintains a clean documentation-focused structure for core game materials and assets:

```
root/
├── docs/           # Gameplay rules, printing guides, development notes
├── assets/         # Logos, card templates, and artwork
└── README.md       # Project overview and links
```

Community discussion and collaboration happens entirely on Discord to maintain focus on documentation and game assets. Digital tools are developed in separate repositories and are not part of this documentation-focused repository.
