# Digital Tools Overview

Future digital tools will be developed in separate repositories to keep this repository focused on documentation and assets only.

Planned digital tools include:
- Discord bot for rules lookup and card search
- Web-based deck builder and card gallery
- Tournament organization and tracking systems
- Digital playtest environments

All digital tool development discussions happen on Discord. This repository maintains only game documentation, rules, and printable assets.
